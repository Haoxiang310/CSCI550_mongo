About
=====

The *gdbmongo* package contains GDB pretty printers and commands for
debugging the MongoDB Server. Its primary target audience is MongoDB
employees.

Motivation
----------

The *gdbmongo* package is mostly born out of joy from tinkering with
low-level constructs while writing GDB pretty printers. There are a few
explicit areas for what it aims to achieve:

1. GDB pretty printers and commands which only work against live MongoDB
   processes are of limited value to the Sharding team. This is because
   very rarely does the hang analyzer actually have enough time in
   Evergreen to successfully attach to each of the processes. Only by
   good luck can it happen to have attached to the problematic one.
   GDB pretty printers and commands which are implemented by walking
   in-memory data structures and not by executing C++ code **can run
   against core dumps** and are therefore more widely applicable.

2. There are new versions of the MongoDB Server being released every
   quarter and every year. Each new git branch fragments the tooling for
   testing the server. It can cause development on older branches to
   feel foreign and awkward because so many new enhancements were made
   in the meantime. Flipping the model so there's **a single version
   which attempts to work with all supported MongoDB versions** can
   potentially enable more things to "just work." Another way to think
   about it is that the new GDB pretty printers and commands may not be
   getting built for new MongoDB Server functionality and instead may be
   getting built for a newly-recognized debugging need.

Installation
============

The *gdbmongo* package must be loaded into the Python installation that
the GDB process is running. In particular, launching ``gdb`` from within
a Python virtual environment won't give the GDB process access to the
Python packages defined within the virtual environment. This is because
``gdb`` is dynamically linked against *libpython* and therefore always
uses the site-packages of the base installation.

Adding the following snippet to a .gdbinit file will cause ``gdb`` at
launch time to attempt to install the *gdbmongo* package if it isn't
already installed.

.. code-block:: python

    # In your ~/.gdbinit:
    python
    try:
        import gdbmongo
    except ImportError:
        import sys
        if sys.prefix.startswith("/opt/mongodbtoolchain/"):
            import subprocess
            subprocess.run([sys.prefix + "/bin/python3", "-m", "pip", "install", "gdbmongo"], check=True)
            import gdbmongo
        else:
            import warnings
            warnings.warn("Not attempting to install gdbmongo into non MongoDB toolchain Python")

    if "gdbmongo" in dir():
        gdbmongo.register_printers()
    end

If you don't plan to use the GDB pretty printers defined in the
mongodb/mongo repository then you may want to consider registering some
of the other printers defined by the *gdbmongo* package.

.. pull-quote::

    register_printers(\*, essentials=True, stdlib=False, abseil=False, boost=False, mongo_extras=False)
        Register the pretty printers defined by the gdbmongo package with GDB itself.

        The pretty printer collections other than gdbmongo-essentials are defaulted to off to avoid
        conflicting with the pretty printers defined in the mongodb/mongo repository.

Usage
=====

The *gdbmongo* package is a nascent GDB extension and quite limited in
what it can do right now. But, if you're looking to dump the contents of
the global ``LockManager`` in a core dump, then you can run the
following commands:

.. code-block:: python

    (gdb) python lock_mgr = gdbmongo.LockManagerPrinter.from_global()
    (gdb) python print(lock_mgr.val)
