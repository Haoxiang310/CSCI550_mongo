## Description

This is a Python client library for interacting with Evergreen and Evergreen objects. It currently only
supports the V2 version of Evergreen's api. It can be used either by Python code in a separate application
or on the command line to get data about Evergreen objects quickly and easily.

## Getting Help

### What's the right channel to ask my question?

If you have a question about evergreen.py, please mention @dag-on-call in
slack channel [#evergreen-users](https://mongodb.slack.com/messages/#evergreen-users/),
or email us at devprod-si-team@mongodb.com.

### How can I request a change/report a bug in evergreen.py?

Create a [DEVPROD ticket](https://jira.mongodb.org/projects/DEVPROD).

### What should I include in my ticket or #evergreen-users question?

Since #evergreen-users questions are interrupts,
please include as much information as possible.
This can help avoid long information-gathering threads.

Please include the following:

- **Motivation for Request**
  - provide us the motivation for this change.
- **Context**
  - provide some background contexts for this issue.
- **Description**
  - provide some descriptions on how this issue happened.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.9 or later

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install evergreen.py
```

## Usage

This client can be used either in code or directly via the command line.

In code:

```python
>> from evergreen.api import EvgAuth, EvergreenApi
>> api = EvergreenApi.get_api(EvgAuth('your.username', '***'))
>> project = api.project_by_id('mongodb-mongo-master')
>> project.display_name
'MongoDB (master)'
```

Cli:

```bash
$ evg-api --json list-hosts
{
    "host_id": "host num 0",
    "host_url": "host.num.com",
    "distro": {
        "distro_id": "ubuntu1804-build",
        "provider": "static",
        "image_id": ""
    },
    "provisioned": true,
    "started_by": "mci",
    "host_type": "",
    "user": "mci-exec",
    "status": "running",
    "running_task": {
        "task_id": null,
        "name": null,
        "dispatch_time": null,
        "version_id": null,
        "build_id": null
    },
    "user_host": false
}
```

The `patch_from_diff` API requires the Evergreen CLI to be installed.
Add the following to the host's DOCKERFILE:

```bash
RUN wget https://evergreen.mongodb.com/clients/linux_amd64/evergreen
RUN chmod +x evergreen
ENV PATH="/project:$PATH"
```

You will need to provide an .evergreen.yml file with credentials to use the CLI. Assuming you are using the [web-app](https://github.com/10gen/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/web-app) chart this can be done by [mounting](https://kanopy.corp.mongodb.com/docs/getting_started/application_configuration/#configuration-filesvolumes) [kubernetes secrets](https://kanopy.corp.mongodb.com/docs/cheatsheet/#interacting-with-kubernetes-secrets) in your pod.

Store the secret in the cluster:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic <secret_name> --from-file .evergreen.yml --namespace <namespace>
```

In environments/deployment.yml configure the file to be mounted and linked to the correct location:

```yaml
volumeSecrets:
  - name: <secret_name>
    path: /etc/secrets
lifecycle:
  postStart:
    type: exec
    command:
      - /bin/sh
      - -c
      - ln -sf /etc/secrets/.evergreen.yml
```

## Contributor's Guide

### Setting up a local development environment

#### Requirements

- Poetry 1.1 or later

You will need Evergreen credentials on your local machine to use this library or the attached CLI. You
can set up your credentials by following the link [here](https://github.com/evergreen-ci/evergreen/wiki/Using-the-Command-Line-Tool#downloading-the-command-line-tool).

### Linting/formatting

This project uses [black](https://github.com/psf/black) and [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) for linting/formatting.

```bash
poetry run black src tests
poetry run isort src tests
```

### Running tests

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

There are a few tests that are slow running. These tests are not run by default, but can be included
by setting the env variable RUN_SLOW_TESTS to any value.

```
$ RUN_SLOW_TEST=1 poetry run pytest
```

To get code coverage information:

```
$ poetry run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html
```

### Automatically running checks on commit

This project has [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) configured. Pre-commit will run
configured checks at git commit time. To enable pre-commit on your local repository run:

```bash
$ poetry run pre-commit install
```

### Versioning

Before deploying a new version, please update the `CHANGELOG.md` file with a description of what
is being changed.

Deployment to [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/evergreen.py/) are done automatically on merges to master.
In order to avoid overwriting a previous deploy, the version should be updated on all changes. The
[semver](https://semver.org/) versioning scheme should be used for determining the version number.

The version is found in the `pyproject.toml` file.

### Code Review

This project uses the [Evergreen Commit Queue](https://github.com/evergreen-ci/evergreen/wiki/Commit-Queue#pr).
Add a PR comment with `evergreen merge` to trigger a merge.

### Deployment

Deployment to [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/evergreen.py/) is automatically triggered on merges to master.
